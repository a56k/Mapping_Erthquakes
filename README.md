## Mapping_Earthquakes

In this module, we use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake should have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

## Scope of the Project

### Purpose of the project 

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Task

To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Approach 

The approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Plus, we're asked to use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
